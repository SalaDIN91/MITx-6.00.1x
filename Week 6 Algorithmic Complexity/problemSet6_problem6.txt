Problem 6-1

Answer the questions below based on the following sorting function. If it helps, 
you may paste the code in your programming environment. Study the output to make 
sure you understand the way it sorts.

def swapSort(L): 
    """ L is a list on integers """
    print("Original L: ", L)
    for i in range(len(L)):
        for j in range(i+1, len(L)):
            if L[j] < L[i]:
                # the next line is a short 
                # form for swap L[i] and L[j]
                L[j], L[i] = L[i], L[j] 
                print(L)
    print("Final L: ", L)
    
Does this function sort the list in increasing or decreasing order? (items at lower 
indices being smaller means it sorts in increasing order, and vice versa)

Answer
Increasing - correct



Problem 6-2

What is the worst case time complexity of swapSort? Consider different kinds of 
lists when the length of the list is large.

Answer
O(n2) - correct



Problem 6-3

If we make a small change to the line for j in range(i+1, len(L)): such that the 
code becomes:

def modSwapSort(L): 
    """ L is a list on integers """
    print("Original L: ", L)
    for i in range(len(L)):
        for j in range(len(L)):
            if L[j] < L[i]:
                # the next line is a short 
                # form for swap L[i] and L[j]
                L[j], L[i] = L[i], L[j] 
                print(L)
    print("Final L: ", L)
    
What happens to the behavior of swapSort with this new code?

Answer
modSwapSort now orders the list in descending order for all lists - correct



Problem 6-4

What happens to the time complexity of this modSwapSort?

Answer
Best and worst cases stay the same. - maybe
Worst case stays the same but best case changes. incorrect
